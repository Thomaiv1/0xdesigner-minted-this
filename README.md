### ❓ why not zora ZDK?

the docs were a little bit outdated and was hard to keep digging types to see what params were correct

### ❓ why not block monitoring using like viem.sh?

developing stuff in web3 for around 9 years, i still think one of the hardest shit to do is block monitoring without failing. it's easy to miss blocks, and things can go haywire when the rpc servers are unstable. going back to dig missed blocks is also painful.

### ❓ why no database?

it's just for 0xdesigner's custom niche case. if you wanna build on top of this go ahead.

### ❓ the code looks too hacky?

it's good code if it runs and does its job.
